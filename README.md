Please refer to the AXI_3 Slave encrypted DUT provided in the GitHub link. You'll find the DUT under the AXI_3_slave directory. Although the file is encrypted and has a .svp extension, you should instantiate it in your testbench just like you would with any regular DUT.

Important:

Treat the encrypted .svp file as a black-box module.

Do not make any changes to the .svp file.

Ensure your instantiation matches the DUT port interface as described.

Let me know if you face any issues during the connection.
